# AI Case Study

## Machine Learning and AI in Radiology

* Name of company

* When was the company incorporated?

* Who are the founders of the company?

* where did the idea originate

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## Landscape

* Medical Radiology

* In the current health care market, AI tools for radiologists dominate. Seventy-five percent of the over 500 FDA-cleared AI algorithms target radiology practice, increasing from 70% in 2021 ^(2)

* Key Competitors, by region ^(3):
    USA; Nines, RapidAI, VIDA Diagnostics, Arterys was a player in the field and has recently merged with Tempus (this is an interesteing merger, as many
    Radiologists are predicting that the future of AI in Radiology will involve Generative AI taking over or organizing multiple smaller ML & AI comapnies),
    MRIS, Enlitic, Subtle Medicine, Dyad Medical, Covera Health, Quantively, Braid Health, QMENTA, Viz.ai
    Israel; PerSimiO, DIA Imaging analysis, Nucleai, Zebra Medical Vision, Aidoc
    South Korea; Lunit, DDH
    China; Deep01, Voxel Cloud
    India; Qure.ai
    France; AZmed, Gleamer,Therapixel
    Spain; QUIBIM
    UK; Kheiron Medical Technologies, Encord, Brainomix
    Singapore; Qritive
    Netherlands; Quantib, Radiobotics
     Germany; CellmatiQ

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
