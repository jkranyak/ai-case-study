## Machine Learning and AI in Radiology

* **Tempus**

* Tempus was founded in August of 2015 by Eric Lefkofsky, after his wife was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. <sup>7</sup>

* The company has raised over[ $1.3 billion]([url](https://news.crunchbase.com/health-wellness-biotech/biotech-drug-development-venture-funding-tempus/#:~:text=Biotech%20upstart%20Tempus%20announced%20on,debt%20financing%20from%20Ares%20Management.)), per Crunchbase. Recently Tempus raised $275 million through equity from previous investors and debt financing from Ares   Management. 

## Business Activities

* According to the [Tempus website](https://www.tempus.com/radiology/), "AI-enabled solutions that provide advanced insights based on radiology images
  We build solutions that generate actionable insights from radiology images to help providers make more informed diagnostic and treatment decisions."<sup>6</sup>
  Tempus started as a company involved in AI genomics, and has been slowly moving into other areas of generative medical AI.  

* Radiologists in the United States alone number around 50,000<sup>4</sup>.  They are in the top 10 highest paid doctors annually in our country<sup>5</sup>, and
  are rececently becoming subjected to burnout due to overloads, which can be mitigated by AI implemetation.<sup>1</sup>

* Tempus is working on acquiring multiple other AI platforms in order to combine them into a larger generative AI competitor in the field of Radiology. Most          recently acquired the emerging company Arterys, Arterys was previously the front runner in building an AI platform specifically designed for medical imaging,
  enabling physicians to make informed treatment decisions and deliver better patient care.  From Tempus' announcement on Arterys webpage;
   
  "Tempus is a leading technology company that is advancing precision medicine through the practical application of data and
  artificial intelligence in healthcare.By joining forces, Arterys’ product will be integrated into Tempus’ solutions, enabling providers to access a comprehensive
  patient view (now inclusive of radiology scans) and researchers to leverage this new data modality to optimize the drug development process."
  
* Tempus is using a multifacted approach to using generative AI to connect multiple sectors of medicine under one umbrella.  The future of medical AI, which
  will all likely all begiin to stem from Radiology.  this is my personal cojecture, as Radiology is the platform that interstects all medical specialties ^(8).      The Tempus plan according to their website is to build "...the platform for oncology... (expanding) it to neuropsychiatry, cardiology, infectious disease, and      radiology." Given this mission, the acquiring of Arterys would be a logical step towards their goal.

## Landscape

* **Medical Radiology**

* According to an [article](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.231114#:~:text=1.-,Radiology%20Will%20Continue%20to%20Lead%20the%20Way%20for%20AI%20in,%25%20in%202021%20(2)) published by the Radiology Society of North America "In the current health care market, AI tools for radiologists dominate. Seventy-five    percent of the over 500 FDA-cleared AI algorithms target radiology practice, increasing from 70% in 2021"<sup>2</sup>

* **Key Competitors**, by region<sup>3</sup>:
    USA; Nines, RapidAI, VIDA Diagnostics,MRIS, Enlitic, Subtle Medicine, Dyad Medical, Covera Health, Quantively, Braid Health, QMENTA, Viz.ai
    Israel; PerSimiO, DIA Imaging analysis, Nucleai, Zebra Medical Vision, Aidoc
    South Korea; Lunit, DDH
    China; Deep01, Voxel Cloud
    India; Qure.ai
    France; AZmed, Gleamer,Therapixel
    Spain; QUIBIM
    UK; Kheiron Medical Technologies, Encord, Brainomix
    Singapore; Qritive
    Netherlands; Quantib, Radiobotics
    Germany; CellmatiQ

## Results

* To date Tempus has had impacts in and become a leader in the following medical ML & AI areas; genomic sequencing, clinical data structuring, image recognition, biological modeling and TIME Trial technology platform. <sup>8</sup>  

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

## Recommendations

* Key advanced business tactices from this company should include working with companies such as [Radhall]([url](https://www.f6s.com/company/radhall#about)) to gain access to larger emerging MML imaging databases,     or trying to acquire them as part of their expanding portfolio. As they grow larger and more competitive, swallowing specialized startups and creating a larger     generative AI machine that is capable of cross disciplinary interactions would be the cutting edge of medical AI advancements. 

* Just as Amazon took over the footprint where there once stood thousands of specialized retail stores online, there will be conglomerate takeovers of the medical
  artifical intelligence world as well.

* I would recommend that this company begins to acquire access or ownership of large informational databases, access to images and information to feed thier AI and
  Machine Learning programs.  This will keep them ultra competitive, especially if they are able to remove competitors access to the same system, or better yet,
  regluate and charge for this access. I would further recomend they add an additional sector to thier management team that focused on the regulatory side of         medical information, once they are on the upside of growth, mitigating future loss and risk will depend on their ability to purchase and lobby political            influence to close off competitive entry.  This could potentially be leverage by using regulatory ignorance in the field of AI to create a need for privatization   of anonymous data. 

* These ideas are appropriate for this company because access to informaton and data is the core of AI and Machine learning. Eventually the information stream may    be cut off by privatization of this informatoin and without it, smaller comapnies would be left unable to compete.
